At First i'll build a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Later, I'll learn modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility by building a quiz site.

Finally, i'll learn how to make webpages that responds to different screen size by building a photo gallery with Flexbox, and a magazine article layout with CSS grid.
